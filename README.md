# PaperBinaryMNARmultilevelData
This material belongs to the paper draft "Multiple Imputation of Non-ignorable Missing Multilevel Data Using a Censored Bivariate Probit Model" by A. Hammon and S. Zinn

It contains the R functions for multiply imputing binary missing data under assuming MNAR that can be incorporated in Stef van Buuren's mice function as well as the package source of the package "bivprob.quad" that is required for estimating the censored bivariate probit models with random intercepts. In addition, we provide the R code of our application to empirical data and an extract of our simulation study

Beware that using the data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS): Starting Cohort Grade 9, doi:10.5157/NEPS:SC4:9.0.0 as done in the application of this paper requires a contract of use with the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories in Bamberg/Germany.
